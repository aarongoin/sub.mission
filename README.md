# sub.mission
## By Aaron Goin

sub.mission is a 2D naval warfare game that puts the Player in control of a nuclear submarine. The player must navigate an underwater landscape, use stealth to slip past enemy vessels hunting them, or use the element of surprise to sink unwary surface ships. Enemy vessels and aircraft will work together to find and sink you, as you work to complete one of several missions.
