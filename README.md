# sub.mission
### By Aaron Goin

sub.mission is a 2D naval warfare game that puts the Player in control of a nuclear submarine. The player must navigate an underwater landscape, use stealth to slip past enemy vessels hunting them, or use the element of surprise to sink unwary surface ships. Enemy vessels and aircraft will work together to find and sink you, as you work to complete one of two missions.

## Controls

Control the game with your mouse. 

Mouse over your submarine to adjust your bearing and click to set it. 

Adjust your depth with the meter on the right.

Adjust your speed with the meter on the bottom. 

In the bottom-left corner you can see your torpedoes and decoys, as well as three buttons. The far left button will deploy your towed-sonar array which will increase your detection. The far right button will deploy a torpedo decoy which will divert incoming enemy torpedoes. The middle button will retract whichever towable item you have deployed.

Click on other ships to try to get a lock on them. If you can lock on, one of your torpedoes will be launched at that vessel--if you have one left in your arsenal.
