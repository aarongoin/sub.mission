# BREAKOUT
## By Aaron Goin

This is a different take on the the Breakout genre, with the bricks being asteroids in belts surrounding the sun that captures your ball and about which your paddle rotates. Asteroids move somewhat freely, though they remain "captured" in their belts, and they break into debris when destroyed. Debris can collide with the ball though it is very light, but will eventually be swallowed up into the sun.

The graphics are simplistic, and were made by myself. Sound is fairly minimal.
